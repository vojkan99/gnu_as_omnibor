# GNU as with OmniBOR implementation

This repository contains the GNU assembler from the GNU BinUtils set of tools, with the OmniBOR implementation.

OmniBOR is a minimalistic scheme for different build tools which accept one or more input artifacts as their input and produce one or more artifacts as their result.
It is designed to track artifact dependencies in software projects and provide a more efficient and precise way to perform software identification.

For more information about the OmniBOR project, please refer to https://omnibor.io/.
